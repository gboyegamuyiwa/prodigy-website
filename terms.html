                                Fixes for newly built websites or applications need to be identified within a 14-day period from going live. If fixes are identified after this period and the client is not on a Maintenance agreement then a quotation will be issued to commence such fixes.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Prodigy Technologies Ltd cannot future-proof its services or products. Once a client has signed off on a project, the responsibility to maintain and update plugins and Themes used on the website or applications becomes the client’s responsibility unless a maintenance agreement has been signed with Prodigy Technologies Ltd which covers such incidents.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                It should be noted however, that, maintenance does not mean “eyes on the website or applications” all the time and issues on the website or applications still need to be reported to Prodigy Technologies Ltd.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Hosting and website faults remain the responsibility of the hosting provider and do not fall under our maintenance agreement.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                It should also be noted that maintenance agreement or contract with clients is not automatic. Both parties have to enter into a separate agreement at the completion of a project.

                                We cannot be held responsible for any websites or applications that have stopped working or have become faulty over time due to the website or application becoming “outdated”. Outdated websites or applications can be affected as a result of new browser software, outdated web code, etc. Prodigy Technologies Ltd cannot be expected to keep your website or application updated in every aspect without being contracted to do so. If such situation arises, the Client may need to have their website or application redeveloped at additional cost.
                            </li>

                                Clients should also take note that SMS and Email subscription purchased are exhaustible and therefore need to be renewed when necessary. When such happens, Prodigy Technologies Ltd will invoice for a new subscription.
